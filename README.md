# sign-up-form
Odin Project sign-up form from Intermediate HTML and CSS


In this project I want to practice layout building and some simpler client-side form control. Having had mostly experience with building websites in ASP.NET I have relied heavily on tag helpers and server-side validation and although it is quite convenient I realize it is not sufficient if I want to operate in other stacks just as well.
